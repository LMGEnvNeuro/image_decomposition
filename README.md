# image_decomposition
 Repository of toolboxes and scripts for image decomposition into a set of low-level visual features

## Contents: 
* WholeIm_Decomposer - toolbox to extraxt hue, saturation, brightness, entropy, edge density. Modified in LMG by CC & IMS. Method used in Nature_gradient & ARCH studies.

* Str_Nstr_DecomposerV3 - 3 versions of function to extract straight & non-straight edge density. Used in publications [1] & [2]. Modified by CC (Str_NStr_DecomposerV3c.m) and IMS (Str_NStr_DecomposerV3ci.m). Method used in Nature_gradient & ARCH studies.  

* Count_Colors_variableDup - function to qualtify colours on the images. Created by Carlos Cassanello. 

* fractal_analysis - function conducting fractal analysis of the image using boxcounting with either binary or differential method. Created by IMS. Method as used in:

& ARCH studies (in preparation)  

### Update
04.2023 - Touch ups on toolboxes. Code still in need of clean up.
